 * @brief Covert a string to a 32-bit integer
 * @date 2022-06-21
 * @link https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/ @endlink 
 * 
 * Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function).
 * The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:
 * 1. Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
 * 2. Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either. 
 *    This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
 * 3. Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
 * 4. Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. "123" -> 123, "0032" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary.
 * 5. If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. 
 *    Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1.
 * 6. Return the integer as the final result.
 * 
 * Note:
 * Only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.
 * Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.

/**
 * @brief Example 1:
 * Input: s = "42"
 * Output: 42
 * Explanation: The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.
 * 
 * 
 * @brief Example 2:
 * Input: s = "   -42"
 * Output: -42
 * Explanation: "___-42" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
 * 
 * 
 * @brief Example 3:
 * Input: s = "4193 with words"
 * Output: 4193
 * Explanation: "4193 with words" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
 * 
 * 
 * @brief Example 4:
 * Input: s = "words and 987"
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: The first non-whitespace character is 'w', which is not a numerical digit or a +/- sign. Therefore no valid conversion could be performed.
 * 
 * 
 * @brief Example 5:
 * Input: s = "-91283472332"
 * Output: -2147483648
 * Explanation: The number "-91283472332" is out of the range of a 32-bit signed integer. Thefore INT_MIN (âˆ’2^31) is returned.
